# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the company) based on their demographics, subscribed services, and account information.  
This AI-powered model can help the company identify customers at risk and take proactive actions to retain them.
